# heap-backend

-Update (22Nov2016)-

SecWV was a blast.  Took 2nd in the CTF, and the
talk went amazingly well.  So much so that a lot
of interest has been drummed up in HEAP, and 
I've received quite a few offers from businesses
and a few .gov's relating to interesting in 
licensing... 

Naturally, this has caused a further delay in
the plans to release the source for the project,
since it may cause issues with those requests.

We're currently re-exploring all of our options
here, with the stated goal of still intending to
release, at a minimum, the core source here on 
github.  Depending on how the rest of this shakes
out, the remainder could come in one of a variety
of possible setups.

We'll try to keep the repo's updated as things
progress for your sanity though.

Cheers,

This is Project HEAP's back-end repository

Note - I've pushed release of this to coincide with
my final speaking engagement of the year @ 
SecureWV / Hack3rCon 2016 on Nov 18th-Nov 20th.

Check back at that time for source! :-)
